PARAMETRIC & COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY — SELF-STUDY PATHWAY
For designers with high school calculus, returning after a gap
=========================================================================
Estimated total commitment: 12–18 months at 5–7 hours per week
Practical returns begin from Phase 2 onward (~3 months in)


=========================================================================
PHASE 1 — Reconnect with the Foundations
Estimated time: 6–8 weeks
=========================================================================

The goal here is not mechanical drill but rebuilding geometric intuition.
Don't skip this phase even if it feels like backtracking. The intuition
you rebuild here is what makes everything in later phases feel motivated
rather than arbitrary.

Name:     Essence of Calculus — 3Blue1Brown
Link:     https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr
Format:   YouTube series (~3 hours total, free)
How to use: Watch in order without pausing to take notes. Let the
            geometric intuition rebuild passively. The goal is to
            remember *why* derivatives and integrals exist, not how
            to execute them. Directly primes your understanding of
            curvature in later phases.

RESOURCE 2
Name:     Calculus 1 & 2 — Professor Leonard
Link:     https://www.youtube.com/c/ProfessorLeonard
Format:   YouTube lectures (free)
How to use: Work alongside him with a notebook. Do every example before
            he shows the answer. Focus especially on: chain rule, related
            rates, maxima/minima, and inflection points. These map directly
            onto taper curves and curvature logic in parametric modeling.

RESOURCE 3
Name:     Khan Academy — Algebra & Trigonometry
Link:     https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra
          https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry
Format:   Interactive modules (free)
How to use: Use reactively, not systematically. When something in
            Leonard's lectures feels shaky underneath, find the
            relevant Khan Academy module and close that specific gap.
            Don't try to review all of precalculus upfront.

PHASE 1 MILESTONE
You should be able to look at the cosine taper equation:
  r_min + (r_max - r_min) * 0.5 * (1 - cos(π * s))
...and understand why it produces a smooth S-curve, and roughly
sketch its shape without a calculator.


=========================================================================
PHASE 2 — Parametric Thinking and 2D Curves
Estimated time: 4–6 weeks
=========================================================================

The key mental shift in this phase: from "y as a function of x"
to "both x and y as functions of a third variable t." This is
exactly how the bottle profile and all parametric CAD curves work.

RESOURCE 1
Name:     Paul's Online Math Notes — Parametric Equations & Curves
Link:     https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/ParametricEqn.aspx
Format:   Free written notes with practice problems
How to use: Work through the parametric equations section of Calc II
            carefully. Do the practice problems — don't just read.
            Unusually well-written for a free resource. The problem
            sets are well-calibrated for self-study.

RESOURCE 2
Name:     Desmos Graphing Calculator
Link:     https://www.desmos.com/calculator
Format:   Free browser-based graphing tool
How to use: Use for 10–15 minutes daily. Type parametric equations
            and manipulate them live. Recreate the bottle profile
            equation. Try different taper exponents. Build the habit
            of translating between equations and shapes visually.
            Feedback is nearly instant — this is where intuition
            develops fastest.

RESOURCE 3
Name:     A Primer on Bézier Curves — Pomax
Link:     https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo
Format:   Free interactive online book
How to use: Read the first half, up to and including the section on
            curvature. Written explicitly for designers and developers
            doing computational work. The interactive diagrams let you
            manipulate control points and watch the math respond in
            real time. Directly applicable to spine curves in
            Grasshopper and Fusion.

PHASE 2 MILESTONE
You should be able to write a Python function from scratch that
generates a parametric taper curve with variable parameters and
plot it with matplotlib, understanding every line you've written.


=========================================================================
PHASE 3 — Into Three Dimensions
Estimated time: 6–8 weeks
=========================================================================

This is where the script's surface mapping logic (uv_to_3d, surface
normals, curvature weighting) will fully click mathematically.

RESOURCE 1
Name:     Multivariable Calculus 18.02 — MIT OpenCourseWare
Link:     https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/
Format:   Free lectures, notes, and problem sets
How to use: Focus on these units specifically:
              - Vectors and dot products
              - Parametric surfaces
              - Surface normals
              - Double integrals
            Skip the electromagnetism application sections for now.
            Work at least the first few problems of each problem set
            to verify you can execute the concepts, not just follow them.

RESOURCE 2
Name:     Visual Differential Geometry and Forms — Tristan Needham
Link:     https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Differential-Geometry-Forms-Mathematical/dp/0691203695
          (also check your local library)
Format:   Book (paid, ~$50 new, often cheaper secondhand)
How to use: Don't read cover to cover. Use as a companion to the MIT
            course. Read the chapters on curves in space and surface
            curvature in parallel with the relevant OCW lectures.
            Needham shows the geometry of every idea before the
            algebra — the right order for design-background learners.
            The chapters on Gaussian curvature and the shape operator
            are most directly relevant to the script's curvature
            weighting logic.

PHASE 3 MILESTONE
You should be able to derive the surface normal vector at any point
on the bottle profile by hand, and explain why the script uses the
outward radial direction as the construction plane normal for a
surface of revolution.


=========================================================================
PHASE 4 — Computational Geometry and Voronoi Diagrams
Estimated time: 4–6 weeks
=========================================================================

By this point you have enough mathematical maturity to engage with
the algorithms directly. The emphasis here is on building things
from scratch before reading the formal theory.

RESOURCE 1
Name:     The Nature of Code — Daniel Shiffman
Link:     https://natureofcode.com  (free online)
          https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain  (companion videos)
Format:   Free online book + YouTube channel
How to use: Read the chapters on autonomous agents and simulation.
            Then watch the Coding Train Voronoi diagram videos and
            implement a brute-force Voronoi from scratch in Python
            using only matplotlib — assigning grid points to their
            nearest seed, coloring by assignment, plotting. This
            single exercise builds more Voronoi intuition than any
            amount of reading. Written for artists and designers
            who want to understand underlying math.

RESOURCE 2
Name:     Lloyd's Relaxation Algorithm
Link:     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm
          (start here, then search for Python implementations to compare
          against your own)
Format:   Reference + self-implementation exercise
How to use: After building brute-force Voronoi, implement Lloyd's
            relaxation on top of it. It is only ~20 additional lines:
            move each seed to the centroid of its own cell, recompute.
            The result is the even, organic cell distribution seen in
            giraffe skin and dragonfly wings. Understanding why it
            converges connects the algorithm to physical energy
            minimization — the mathematical root of biomimicry.

RESOURCE 3
Name:     Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications
          — de Berg, Cheong, van Kreveld, Overmars
Link:     https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540779735
          (check your local university library for free access)
Format:   Book (paid, commonly available in libraries)
How to use: At this stage read only:
              - The introduction
              - Chapter on Voronoi diagrams
              - Chapter on Delaunay triangulations
            The formal treatment will feel accessible now that you've
            already built the brute-force version yourself. Don't
            attempt to read the full book linearly.

PHASE 4 MILESTONE
You should be able to implement a curvature-weighted Voronoi diagram
in 2D Python from scratch — generating seeds with non-uniform density,
computing cells, and visualizing the result — without referring to the
original script.


=========================================================================
PHASE 5 — Connecting Back to the Design Tools
Estimated time: Ongoing
=========================================================================

At this stage structured learning gives way to going deeper on
specific topics as they become relevant to actual projects.

RESOURCE 1
Name:     Discrete Differential Geometry — Keenan Crane (CMU)
Link:     https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/
          https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz0hIrNCMQW1YmZysAiIYSSS
Format:   Free course notes and lectures
How to use: This course explains how the continuous differential
            geometry from Phase 3 gets approximated and computed
            on meshes — exactly what Grasshopper and Blender's
            Geometry Nodes are doing under the hood. Read the
            chapters on discrete curvature and the Laplacian first.
            Directly relevant to mesh-based lattice generation.

RESOURCE 2
Name:     Physically Based Rendering (pbr-book) — Pharr, Jakob, Humphreys
Link:     https://pbr-book.org  (free online, full text)
Format:   Free online book
How to use: Read the Monte Carlo integration and sampling chapters.
            These explain the inverse CDF sampling technique in the
            script with full mathematical rigor. Reading this after
            Phase 4 connects probability theory to the geometric
            intuition you've built. The rest of the book is about
            rendering and optional.

RESOURCE 3
Name:     scipy.spatial documentation — Voronoi and Delaunay
Link:     https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.html
Format:   Free reference documentation
How to use: Once you understand the theory, read through scipy's
            spatial module to see how production implementations
            handle edge cases, infinite regions, and numerical
            stability. Then refactor your own brute-force Voronoi
            to use scipy.spatial.Voronoi and compare the outputs.
            This is the upgrade path for the Fusion script too.


=========================================================================
SUPPLEMENTARY TOOLS — USE THROUGHOUT ALL PHASES
=========================================================================

Desmos (graphing)
  https://www.desmos.com/calculator
  Live parametric curve exploration. Use constantly.

GeoGebra (geometry + calculus)
  https://www.geogebra.org
  More powerful than Desmos for 3D and differential geometry.
  Particularly useful in Phase 3 for visualizing surface normals
  and curvature on 3D surfaces interactively.

Wolfram Alpha (computation)
  https://www.wolframalpha.com
  Use to check derivatives and integrals when you're unsure.
  Type equations in plain English or standard notation.

Python + matplotlib (implementation)
  https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html
  Every concept encountered should be implemented and plotted.
  This is non-negotiable — mathematical understanding that lives
  only on paper does not transfer into design tools.


=========================================================================
REALISTIC TIME & APPROACH NOTES
=========================================================================

Total estimated time: 12–18 months at 5–7 hours per week

Phase 1:  6–8 weeks   (rebuilding intuition)
Phase 2:  4–6 weeks   (parametric curves, first practical returns)
Phase 3:  6–8 weeks   (3D surfaces, script logic fully understood)
Phase 4:  4–6 weeks   (Voronoi from scratch)
Phase 5:  Ongoing     (project-driven deepening)

The single most important habit across all phases:
Implement everything in code and plot the output.
Every concept should become a function, be visualized, and be varied.
That feedback loop is what builds the intuition that transfers into
design decisions inside Fusion, Grasshopper, and Blender.
